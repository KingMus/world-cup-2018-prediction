# World Cup 2018 - Prediction

#### Who?

[thaasoph](https://github.com/thaasoph) and I are working on this project. 

#### What?

This repository contains jupyter notebooks to predict football games between two nations. The trained algorithm is used to predict the football world cup 2018 in Russia.

#### How?

We use python and [jupyter lab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab), also we use [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) for the models. The most work is to preprocess the data, using machine learning algorithms takes a much smaller amount of time.

#### Source of Data?

Most data sources are kaggle-datasets about Football games and players, also [transfermarkt.de](https://www.transfermarkt.de/) is a really good source.

### The prediction

This is the result of the first prediction: <br>
